      By default, the coursier cache is assumed to be in the default OS-dependent location.
      Set this input to override that. Note that this action will also set COURSIER_CACHE
      if an override is specified, so that you don't have to set it yourself.

      By default, sbt build definition files (*.sbt, project/**.{scala,sbt}, project/build.properties) and
      mill build definition files (*.sc, ./mill) are hashed to uniquely identify the cached data. Upon
      cache restoration, if an exact match is found, the cache is not saved again at the end of the job.
      In case of no exact match, it is assumed new files may have been fetched; the previous cache for the
      current OS, if any, is restored, but a new cache is persisted with a new key at the end of the job.
